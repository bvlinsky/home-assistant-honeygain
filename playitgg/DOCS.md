# Home Assistant Playit.gg Add-on

Playit.gg is a global proxy that allows anyone to host a server without port forwarding. We use tunneling. Only the server needs to run the program, not every player!

## Quick Configuration Guide

1. If you don't already have a Playit.gg account, head over to Playit.gg and sign up.
2. In Home Assistant, navigate to "Supervisor" > "Add-on Store" and search for the Playit.gg add-on. Once found, click on it and go to the "Configuration" tab.
3. In your Playit.gg account, you will need your secret key to link your node. You can obtain this by creating a new Docker agent on the Playit.gg website.
5. After filling out the required fields, save the configuration and restart the Playit.gg add-on.
6. Finally, check the add-on logs to ensure the add-on has successfully connected to your Playit.gg account.
